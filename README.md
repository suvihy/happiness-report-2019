# happiness-report-2019
A school project about World Happiness Report data. My first try with D3.js.

Data source: Our World in Data, https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction

Inspiration: The World Happiness Report and Our World in Data - wanted to see how the world happiness is evolved through decades

Improvements I’d still do:
#1 The labels are missing (should show country name while hovering on each line)
#2 The percent scale should be on top, now the viewer has to scroll all the way down to see it
#2 Some additional text and world events would make the visualisation more interesting: a viewer could compare happiness rate to what’s happening in the world at the same time.
